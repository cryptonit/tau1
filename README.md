# How to ...

## run a node

**Prepare**  
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lab10-coop/tau1
cd tau1
./download-parity.sh
./parity -c node.toml
```
to keep node running after ssh connection is closed following link can give inspiration
https://askubuntu.com/questions/8653/how-to-keep-processes-running-after-ending-ssh-session
a bit downward in this guide under **Keep running** is also a explaination how to configure a service for the node

**Upgrade**
stop node (deepens how u started it)
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lab10-coop/tau1 temp/tau1
cp -rf temp/tau1 ~/
rm -rf temp
cd tau1
```
start node (as explained in **Run a node** )
```
./parity -c node.toml
```

## run a trustnode
  
**Prepare**
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lab10-coop/tau1
cd tau1
./download-parity.sh
```
start in normal node mode once so all folders are created
```
./parity -c node.toml
```
stop node after a 30 seconds

**Add your _mining key_**
* Copy the keyfile (json) of your mining key into `data/keys/tau1.artis` (create directory if it doesn't exist yet). The filename doesn't matter.

u can just generate a new file and copy the content of ur json file into it
```
nano ~/tau1/data/keys/tau1.artis/miningkey
```
how to generate a new address and export it in json format is not covered in this guide
artis addresses are generated the same way as ethereum addresses so any tool that generate ethereum addresses can be used
example https://www.myetherwallet.com/

* Create a file `password.txt` containing the password to unlock the keyfile.
```
nano password.txt
```

**Adapt the config**  
* Copy `trustnode.toml.example` to `trustnode.toml`.
* Open `trustnode.toml` with your favourite editor and replace every `<PLACEHOLDER>` entry.

result looks like this please keep in mind that address from ur json file have to start with 0x upfront extend address if needed with that in configuration file
```
# name of your node
identity = "GuideTestIdentity"

[account]
password = ["/root/tau1/password.txt"]

# address of your "mining key"
unlock = ["0xyouraddress"]

# address of your "mining key"
engine_signer = "0xyouraddress"
```

**Run**  
`
./parity -c trustnode.toml
`

**Keep running**  
A trustnode is supposed to be always on, thus running it in an interactive shell isn't the best option.  
This repository includes a systemd template config you can use to make parity a system service.  
The following steps require root privileges (sudo).  
* Copy `artis-tau1-parity.service.example` to `/etc/systemd/system/artis-tau1-parity.service` (if that directory doesn't exist, you're likely not using systemd and can't use this method).
```
cp ~/tau1/artis-tau1-parity.service.example /etc/systemd/system/artis-tau1-parity.service
```
* Open the copied file and set _User_, _Group_, _WorkingDirectory_ and _ExecStart_ to the right values for your system
```
nano /etc/systemd/system/artis-tau1-parity.service
```
content of file could look like this:
```
[Unit]
Description=ARTIS tau1 parity service
After=network.target
[Service]
User=root
Group=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/tau1
ExecStart=/root/tau1/parity --config=trustnode.toml
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* Start the service: 
`
systemctl start artis-tau1-parity
`
* Flag service to be started on boot: 
`
systemctl enable artis-tau1-parity
`

You can check the status of the service with 
`
systemctl status artis-tau1-parity
`
or u can get constant refreshing monitoring output of parity.log file with
`
tail -f -n 1000 ~/tau1/parity.log
`
## get listed in status dashboard

There's a nice network status dashboard at http://status.tau1.artis.network/  
It only lists nodes which want to be listed.  
In order to be on the list, a dedicated status reporting application needs to run alongside parity.  

If you run a trustnode, please get listed.  
If you permanently run a normal node, a listing is also welcome!

**Prepare**  
Check which version of nodejs you have installed (if any):
`node --version`  
Anything newer than v6 should do.

If you don't have it installed, your options depend on the operating system.

_Ubuntu 18.04_:  
`apt install nodejs`

_Ubuntu 16.04_:  
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```
(Of course you can take a look into `nodesource_setup.sh` before executing it with root permissions.)

**Install**  
Next, get the application:
```
git clone https://github.com/lab10-coop/node-status-reporter
cd node-status-reporter
npm install
```

**Run**  
Now you _could_ run it with  
`NODE_ENV=production INSTANCE_NAME=<your instance name here> WS_SERVER=http://status.tau1.artis.network WS_SECRET=ahZahhoth3engaem npm start`
ls -al

**Keep running**

If you installed a service for parity, you should do the same for this application.
* Copy `artis-tau1-statusreporter.service.example` to `/etc/systemd/system/artis-tau1-statusreporter.service`.
```
cp ~/tau1/artis-tau1-statusreporter.service.example /etc/systemd/system/artis-tau1-statusreporter.service
```
* Open the copied file and adapt it to your needs. Important: set something for _INSTANCE_NAME_ and _CONTACT_DETAILS_ and then uncomment both.
```
nano /etc/systemd/system/artis-tau1-statusreporter.service
```
* Start the service: `systemctl start artis-tau1-statusreporter`
* Flag service to be started on boot: `systemctl enable artis-tau1-statusreporter`

You can check the status of the service with `systemctl status artis-tau1-statusreporter`.

## use with Metamask

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a browser extension which implements an Ethereum wallet. It can be used with any Ethereum compatible network.  
Once you have Metamask installed:
* Open and unlock Metamask
* Click the _Networks_ dropdown and choose _Custom RPC_
* For _RPC URL_, enter "http://rpc.tau1.artis.network"
* (optional, but convenient) Click _show advanced options_, then enter "ATS" for _Symbol_ and "ARTIS tau1" for _Nickame_
* Click _SAVE_

## get ATS

In order to transact with the network, you need ATS for tx fees.  
There's a faucet for that: call
http://faucet.tau1.artis.network/addr/<ADDRESS_TO_BE_FUNDED>  
(replace <ADDRESS_TO_BE_FUNDED> with the address of the account you want to get ATS for).  Every call triggers a transfer of 1 ATS.  

# About

Ï„1 is an ARTIS testnet.  
It makes use of several open source contributions of the fantastic Ethereum community, most importantly those of [poa.network](https://github.com/poanetwork/) and [Paritytech](https://github.com/paritytech/).

This directory includes a binary build of the parity-ethereum client ([version 2.0.8](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.0.8)) for convenience. Instructions for building from source can be found [here](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum).  
Newer versions of Parity are expected to be compatible (able to sync with this chain), older ones are not!
